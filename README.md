# softcuff
public cuffing from esx_policejob with optional required items

This is esentially a snipit of the arrest function from esx_policejob. In essense this script is allows the cuffed individual freedom of movement while restraining their ability to attack.

Script allows for minor customizability in the form of allowing item requirements for cuffing and releasing.
